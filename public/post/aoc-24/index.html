          <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>[please ignore how late this is]</p>
<p>This (last? 2024&rsquo;s) winter, I completed the Advent of Code (AoC) 2024 puzzles every night from December 1 through December 25. It was a bit easier for me than for the poor chaps on the East Coast as the puzzles were released at 9:00 pm PT (midnight Eastern time) and I could often have them solved and go to sleep by 10:00 pm. Anyways, here are a few scattered thoughts on what I learned and gained.</p>
<p>This was my first year doing AoC, I only discovered it because of a group of AoC competitors at OHS.</p>
<h2 id="my-setup">My setup</h2>
<ul>
<li>All of my original solutions are in Python. I used the <a href="https://github.com/wimglenn/advent-of-code-data"><code>advent-of-code-data</code></a> package with a custom runner script to get puzzle input. The runner script basically continuously reran my program with a 5s wait in between in each run. It used <code>exec</code> to run my solution so it could declare the puzzle input as a variable and then let my solution access it &ndash; this, of course, ended up not being the best option chiefly because of naming conflicts between the runner script and solutions, but it worked.</li>
<li>I used the <a href="https://zed.dev">Zed</a> editor for my solutions, as I have for all of my coding projects for the past year or so. (Sorry VSCode, but I know an Electron app when I see it &ndash; Zed is unimaginably fast)</li>
<li>For the first few days, I used <a href="https://supermaven.com">Supermaven</a> code completion because I had it enabled by default and it definitely sped up the process, but stopped after realizing it violated the AoC rules.</li>
<li>I used a utilities file, which basically just stored useful functions and data structures. This ended up being a godsend despite me having to rewrite it about 2-3 times.
This included vector2 and grid classes, a myriad group of list-related utilities, tools for parsing inputs, and many other random things. The most useful utilities by a long shot were the vector and grid classes &ndash; see <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/adventofcode/comments/1heuw9l/2024_day_15_im_tired_boss/">this meme</a> to understand. The vast majority of my solutions actually no longer work ðŸ˜‚ because of how often I changed my utilities file. Updating them wouldn&rsquo;t be too hard but I&rsquo;m too lazy to do so.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="stuff-i-learned">Stuff I learned</h2>
<p>I learned <em>so much</em> stuff through doing AoC. Here are the highlights:</p>
<p><strong>Python-specific</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>How to properly structure a Python project. I haven&rsquo;t done many large Python things in a while, so this was a bit of a refresher.</li>
<li>Regex! Believe it or not I had near zero experience with regex before AoC, so learning it through a handful of tutorials and getting practice with the <code>re</code> library in Python was nice.</li>
<li>At the time I didn&rsquo;t understand Dijkstra&rsquo;s algorithm or A* (and would be too lazy to implement them even if I did know them) so I gained a lot of experience using the <code>networkx</code> library.</li>
<li>The Python STD libraries like <code>itertools</code>, <code>functools</code>, <code>copy</code>, and <code>collections</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>More generally</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Problem-solving skills. After (or during) solving a day&rsquo;s puzzle, us OHSers would often trade optimizations and ideas for solutions, which not only helped me solve the tasks but also taught me algorithmic thinking yada yada.</li>
<li>Thinking about a 2D grid and vectors/vector transformaions - believe me, it becomes much easier to visualize a grid after solving 20 AoC problems about them.</li>
<li>Patiently waiting for code to finish executing.</li>
<li>A bunch of other things that I&rsquo;m not willing to explain.</li>
</ul>
