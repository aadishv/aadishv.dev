          <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>[please ignore how late this is]</p>
<p>This (last? 2024&rsquo;s) winter, I completed the Advent of Code (AoC) 2024 puzzles every night from December 1 through December 25. It was a bit easier for me than for the poor chaps on the East Coast as the puzzles were released at 9:00 pm PT (midnight Eastern time) and I could often have them solved and go to sleep by 10:00 pm. Anyways, here are a few scattered thoughts on what I learned and gained.</p>
<p>This was my first year doing AoC, I only discovered it because of a group of AoC competitors at OHS.</p>
<h2 id="my-setup">My setup</h2>
<ul>
<li>All of my original solutions are in Python. I used the <a href="https://github.com/wimglenn/advent-of-code-data"><code>advent-of-code-data</code></a> package with a custom runner script to get puzzle input. The runner script basically continuously reran my program with a 5s wait in between in each run. It used <code>exec</code> to run my solution so it could declare the puzzle input as a variable and then let my solution access it &ndash; this, of course, ended up not being the best option chiefly because of naming conflicts between the runner script and solutions, but it worked.</li>
<li>I used the <a href="https://zed.dev">Zed</a> editor for my solutions, as I have for all of my coding projects for the past year or so. (Sorry VSCode, but I know an Electron app when I see it &ndash; Zed is unimaginably fast)</li>
<li>For the first few days, I used <a href="https://supermaven.com">Supermaven</a> code completion because I had it enabled by default and it definitely sped up the process, but stopped after realizing it violated the AoC rules.</li>
<li>I used a <a href="https://github.com/aadishv/aoc/blob/main/utils.py">utilities file</a>, which basically just stored useful functions and data structures. This ended up being a godsend despite me having to rewrite it about 2-3 times.
This included vector2 and grid classes, a myriad group of list-related utilities, tools for parsing inputs, and many other random things. The most useful utilities by a long shot were the vector and grid classes &ndash; see <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/adventofcode/comments/1heuw9l/2024_day_15_im_tired_boss/">this meme</a> to understand. The vast majority of my solutions actually no longer work ðŸ˜‚ because of how often I changed my utilities file. Updating them wouldn&rsquo;t be too hard but I&rsquo;m too lazy to do so.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="stuff-i-learned">Stuff I learned</h2>
<p>I learned <em>so much</em> stuff through doing AoC. Here are the highlights:</p>
<p><strong>Python-specific</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>How to properly structure a Python project. I haven&rsquo;t done many large Python things in a while, so this was a bit of a refresher.</li>
<li>Regex! Believe it or not I had near zero experience with regex before AoC, so learning it through a handful of tutorials and getting practice with the <code>re</code> library in Python was nice.</li>
<li>At the time I didn&rsquo;t understand Dijkstra&rsquo;s algorithm or A* (and would be too lazy to implement them even if I did know them) so I gained a lot of experience using the <code>networkx</code> library.</li>
<li>The Python STD libraries like <code>itertools</code>, <code>functools</code>, <code>copy</code>, and <code>collections</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>More generally</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Problem-solving skills. After (or during) solving a day&rsquo;s puzzle, us OHSers would often trade optimizations and ideas for solutions, which not only helped me solve the tasks but also taught me algorithmic thinking yada yada.</li>
<li>Thinking about a 2D grid and vectors/vector transformaions - believe me, it becomes much easier to visualize a grid after solving 20 AoC problems about them.</li>
<li>Patiently waiting for code to finish executing.</li>
<li>General algorithms &ndash; probably the coolest I learned was dynamic programming (to solve <a href="https://adventofcode.com/2024/day/19">Day 19</a>).</li>
<li>A bunch of other things that I&rsquo;m not willing to explain.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="standout-puzzles">Standout puzzles</h2>
<ol>
<li>My initial solution for <a href="https://adventofcode.com/2024/day/6">Day 6</a> part 2 didn&rsquo;t work; I still don&rsquo;t know why. I submitted the wrong answer something like 5 times in a row. I eventually (23 hours later, one hour before the next puzzle) buckled down and rewrote it.</li>
<li>All of <a href="https://adventofcode.com/2024/day/8">Day 8</a> was honestly a pain for me, especially since I didn&rsquo;t have good grid or vector utilities then. I would keep on messing up my pluses or minuses or doing a similar silly mistake. It took me a while to do it, despite the problem itself being relatively simple.</li>
<li>In <a href="https://adventofcode.com/2024/day/8">Day 9</a>, it took me a while to realize that numbers could be longer than 1 digit ðŸ˜­.</li>
<li>I spent hours pondering <a href="https://adventofcode.com/2024/day/13">Day 13</a>, even rewatching a linear algebra series, before realizing that it was a simple linear equation&hellip;</li>
<li><a href="https://adventofcode.com/2024/day/20">Day 20</a> was an absolute mess, took an hour just for me to understand the problem. Even just using the optimized networkx implementation of Dijkstra&rsquo;s wasn&rsquo;t enough and I had to use a lot of optimizations for part 2.</li>
<li>There were around three puzzles that I had to take a hint from the subreddit from, and <a href="https://adventofcode.com/2024/day/21">Day 21</a> Part 2 was probably the toughest of them. I spent a lot of time figuring out how to create a recursive memoized function for it.</li>
<li>Many puzzles in Advent of Code were challenging, but <a href="https://adventofcode.com/2024/day/24">Day 24</a> Part 2 was the holy grail of AoC problems for me. It took me ages to just find my bearings; I ended up using a hybrid approach using a program to detect errors, manually fixing and noting them, and continuing until it worked. I actually solved Day 24 Part 2 after solving Day 25 Part 1, as I needed to have solved every other problem in order to complete Day 25 Part 2</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="rust">Rust!</h2>
<p>AoC was a great way to spent my December (perhaps not the best way to spend my finals week) but I quickly got bored as winter break set in and AoC finished. In order to not die of said boredom I decided to learn Rust - a language that I&rsquo;ve been wanting to learn for a while (because it looks like Swift, which I love, but is actually cross-platform) but seemed daunting. Welp, I had a lot of free time and nothing else to do, so I YOLOed it and learned Rust.</p>
<p>To be honest, I still only somewhat understand Rust&rsquo;s memory management but just the elegance of the language is amazing &ndash; probably the best DX I&rsquo;ve experienced (especially the notion of a unified build tool with <code>cargo</code>). In order to gain a better understanding of the language and learn helpful functions, I decided to start redoing some AoC24 puzzles in Rust. I&rsquo;m only up to day 9 and am currently on a break from them but it was definitely a fun learning experience.</p>
<p>Through the AoC puzzles, I got experience with:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Rust compiler</li>
<li>Cargo&rsquo;s package management (for importing the regex library)</li>
<li>Using the standard IO crate</li>
<li>Quirks of Rust (&amp;str vs. String, iterators vs. Vec, etc.)</li>
<li>More optimizations, especially when rewriting my grid utilities in Rust. Specifically, I tried out storing coordinates as a u16 where the first 8 bits were the x-coordinate and the last 8 bis the y-coordinate, which improved performance a lot :)</li>
<li>Much much more</li>
</ul>
<p>Definitely worth my time!</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Just for fun, here is my performance on AoC for the initial (Python) run &ndash; pretty mediocre but still a blast.
