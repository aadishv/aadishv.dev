I have been programming for about 5 years and have participated in a variety of projects. These have included the following technologies:
* Python for scripting applications and CLI tools
* Python for machine learning (TensorRT, ONNX, YOLO models, JAX)
* Web technologies (Javascript, HTML, CSS)
* Modern web solutions (React, Astro, Tailwind)
* Low-level languages (C, C++, Rust)
* Application languages and frameworks (Swift, SwiftUI)

⠀[Github profile](https://github.com/aadishv). Unfortunately, many of my contributions are in repositories that are private.
I have also worked on many large-scale projects:
**Web dev**
I recently have learned several web frameworks, centering around TypeScript and TailwindCSS. I've used these frameworks for many projects:
* [My personal website](https://aadishv.github.io/), also using the Astro framework for SSR. [Github](https://github.com/aadishv/aadishv.github.io/)
* [A comprehensive periodic table](https://aadishv.github.io/tools/periodic/), built for the OC005 chemistry course I took at OHS in eight grade. This uses React for interactive portions, as well as a Python portion that scraped multiple sources to obtain element data. (part of my website codebase)
* [A Chrome extension](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/ohs-ac-utilities/mcnjeemajaoopeejjbfiieaepibmbjne) that allows OHS students to easily download Adobe Connect recordings. I am also currently working on adding AI summaries and chat features to improve students' experience when viewing class recordings. [Github](https://github.com/aadishv/ohs-ac-utils/)

**Competitive programming**
* Participated in the [USACO](https://usaco.org/) for one competition this year, using C++ and getting promoted to silver. I am planning to continue partipating and hopefully attain the platinum level. [Solutions](https://github.com/aadishv/usaco)
* Led programming for Team Dole of Doves in the Labor Day Hackathon last year. We won the hackathon. [Github](https://github.com/aadishv/doleofdoves) [Demo](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1tY9xYQxgWX8BaUuugb8C5ZvrLzII6VSt/view?usp=sharing)
* Participated in Advent of Code 2024. Often ranked among the first few hundred people to solve a probem. [Blog](https://aadishv.github.io/aoc/)

⠀**Robotics competitions**
* Participated in the [VEX V5 Robotics Competition](https://www.vexrobotics.com/v5/competition/vrc-current-game) as the lead programmer of team 315P for the Over Under (2023-2024) and High Stakes (2024-2025) seasons. I wrote C++ code using the [PROS](https://pros.cs.purdue.edu/) kernel for the VEX V5 brain to control our robots in competition. 1-time tournament champion, 2-time Excellence Award (highest award possible at a competition), 2-time tournament finalist, and division quarterfinalist as well as receiver of the Amaze Award (highest possible award in our division) at the world championships. [Github](https://github.com/aadishv/highstakes) [Blog post 1](https://aadishv.github.io/robotics-1/) [Blog post 2](https://aadishv.github.io/robotics-2/)
* For the end of the High Stakes season, also participated in the more advanced [VEX AI Robotics Competition](https://www.vexrobotics.com/v5/competition/vex-ai), as lead AI programmer for team 3151A. I personally developed a Python-based tech stack that ran on our coprocessor, an NVIDIA Jetson Nano. This involved running a custom YOLOv5n model, doing trigonometric operations on model outputs to convert between camera and world space, handling serial communications with the V5 brain over USB, and streaming data to a dashboard using SSE. I facilitated the training of multiple YOLOv5n models and orchestrated image labeling across the team. Additionally, I integrated C++ code with other programmers on the team to handle the brain communications with the Jetson, and wrote a TypeScript + React-based dashboard to view our camera and model status. Overall, I wrote around 7000 lines of code in C++, Python, and TypeScript. Unfortunately, our code is still private. I will also be publishing two or three blog posts about the experience in the near future. [Dashboard demo](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1G2VQSgJAAoDd56xgvxzv-vT7gPU_3Na9/view?usp=sharing)

⠀**Robotics tooling**
* I recently created and maintained [DishPy](https://pypi.org/project/dishpy/) (links to PyPI distribution), a community tool to improve the Python development experience on the VEX V5 brain. DishPy is a CLI tool that utilizes VEX internals to expose a simpler project management interface for Python programs. It adds new features including multi-file support and Python libraries. This involves complex manipulation of the abstract syntax tree (AST) and a decentralized package management architecture. [Github](https://github.com/aadishv/dishpy) [Docs](https://aadishv.github.io/dishpy/)
* I am currently working with key members of the VEX community to merge [PR to LemLib](https://github.com/LemLib/LemLib/pull/274) which I recently opened. LemLib is an advanced motion controls library used by hundreds of VEX Robotics teams. I also diagnosed and created the original issue. [Issue](https://github.com/LemLib/LemLib/issues/273) [My fork with fixed code](https://github.com/aadishv/LemLib/tree/stable)
* I am also working with community members on future-leaning projects to port new languages to the VEX V5.
