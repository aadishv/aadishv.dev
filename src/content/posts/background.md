I have been programming for about 5 years and have participated in a variety of projects.

<p><b>Competitions</b></p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <em>Hackathons.</em>
    Led programming for the winning team of the Stanford OHS 2024 Labor Day
    Hackathon. Planning to write a blog post about it later :) [<a

  <li>
    <em>Competitive programming.</em>
    <a href="https://adventofcode.com/2024">Advent of Code</a> 2024 participant.

    for Over Under and part of the High Stakes seasons. I have made a
    <a href="https://github.com/aadishv/highstakes">public mirror</a> of my High
    Stakes code available.
  </li>
  <li>
    <em>Lead AI programmer for VEX AI Robotics Competition team 3151A</em> for
    the High Stakes and Push Back seasons (up until the present). Led work on
    system design, involving training & running a custom computer vision model.
    In total, designed and wrote over 8,000 lines of C++, Python, TypeScript,
    and shell.
    <br />
    Today, I am exploring future-learning work for the team and pushing the
    state of the art in VEX, including
    <ul class="pb-1 -mt-2">
      <li style="line-height: 0.8rem">
        GPU-accelerated Monte Carlo localization with a LiDAR,
      </li>
      <li style="line-height: 0.8rem">
        clustering and object persistence using Kalman filters,
      </li>
      <li style="line-height: 0.8rem">and much more.</li>
    </ul>
    Unfortunately, our code is our secret sauce, so I can't share it :)
  </li>
  <li>
    <em>Open source.</em>
    In conjunction with my work in the VEX community, I've also worked on
    several open-source projects used by hundreds of robotics teams (VEX and
    professional):
    <ul>
      <li>
        A
        <a href="https://github.com/LemLib/LemLib/pull/274"
          >bugfix PR to LemLib,</a
        >
        the most popular motion control and utilities library in the VEX V5
        Robotics Competition. This PR is currently in review and fixes a
        critical bug in the library that would cause it to block indefinitely if
        motions were called under certain competition conditions.
      </li>
      <li>
        A
        <a href="https://github.com/Slamtec/rplidar_sdk/pull/141"
          >bugfix PR to the RPLiDAR C++ SDK.</a
        >
        RPLiDAR is a very commonly used LiDAR series made by the Slamtec
        manufacturer, used in R&D, production cases, and also by the most
        technologically advanced VEX Robotics teams. This PR fixes a critical
        segfault in the SDK occuring due to a loop not checking for when a queue
        was empty.

      <li>
        I am the creator and maintainer of
        <a href="https://github.com/aadishv/dishpy">DishPy</a>, a Python
        development tool for the VEX V5 supporting multiple files, any editor, a
        CLI, and libraries. This offers a massive advantage over the vanilla
        Micropython environment provided by VEX and is in use for competition by
        many teams. [<a href="/dishpy">docs</a>

    <em>I cofounded and help lead development for Dotlist</em>, an open-source
    productivity manager. I architectured the entire frontend and backend and
    continue to help the team make informed decisions with regards to our mobile
    app and hosting infrastructure. I continue to regularly do code review and
    contribute to the codebase. I also lead development on an affiliated app,
    Dotlist Lite, which has less features but more polish. [<a
