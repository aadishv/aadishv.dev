**Helping students at Stanford OHS**

- Led winning teams for the OHS Labor Day Hackathon in 2024 and 2025. Worked on student-focused projects; [a tech issue diagnosis software with integrated AI](https://github.com/aadishv/doleofdoves) [[demo](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1tY9xYQxgWX8BaUuugb8C5ZvrLzII6VSt/view?usp=sharing)] and [AI-powered fact checker to verify social media posts](https://github.com/aadishv/fluorine/) [[demo](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1g-JFRpFuEvoKB7rdCtDtvEMDrhfKEs8_/view?usp=sharing)]. 1st place both years.
- Developed and maintain [OHS AC Utilities](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/ohs-ac-utilities/mcnjeemajaoopeejjbfiieaepibmbjne) [[code](https://github.com/aadishv/ohs-ac-utils)] (100+ users). Offers useful download utility and AI assistant for OHS students accessing class recordings via Adobe Connect.
- As part of my volunteer role in the OHS Board of Communications, wrote a program to automatically generate eKudos emails for the board chair. [blog post](https://aadishv.github.io/ekudos/)
- [Built](https://aadishv.github.io/tools/chinese/) [several](https://aadishv.github.io/tools/periodic/) [tools](https://aadishv.github.io/tools/om013/) to help students in a variety of classes understand course content.

**VEX Robotics**

- Led programming for VEX Robotics Competition team [315P](https://www.robotevents.com/teams/V5RC/315P) (5+ awards including 3x tournament finalist, 1x tournament champion, 1x excellence award world division quarterfinalists). [code](https://github.com/aadishv/highstakes) [blog post 1](https://aadishv.github.io/robotics-1/) [blog post 2](https://aadishv.github.io/robotics-2/)
- Led AI programming for VEX AI Robotics Competition team 3151A, including work on system design, training & running custom CV pipeline, and handling serial communications between VEX and NVIDIA hardware. Designed and wrote >9,000 lines of C++, Python, TypeScript, Rust, and shell. Also explored future-leaning work for the team that pushed the state of the art in VEX Robotics, such as GPU-accelerated Monte Carlo localization via a LiDAR. [blog post 1](https://aadishv.github.io/robotics-3/) [blog post 2](https://aadishv.github.io/robotics-4/) [code (24-25)](https://github.com/aadishv/AIWorlds) [code (25-26)](https://github.com/aadishv/3151a-zenoh)

**Open source**

- Contributed critical bugfixes [to LemLib](https://github.com/LemLib/LemLib/pull/274) (most popular VEX motion control lib, used by hundreds of teams), and [to the RPLiDAR C++ SDK](https://github.com/Slamtec/rplidar_sdk/pull/141) (very commonly used LiDAR SDK made by Slamtec, likely used by thousands if not tens of thousands of projects).
- Created and maintain [DishPy](https://github.com/aadishv/dishpy) (Python development tool for VEX offering a significant advantage over the VEX Micropython runtime, in competitive use by many teams). [[docs](/dishpy) [blog post](/dishpy-blog)]
- Designed, wrote, and maintain [website](https://venice.fibn.cc/) for the [Venice open source Micropython runtime for VEX V5](https://github.com/venice-v5/). Active contributor to [Venice CLI](https://github.com/venice-v5/venice-cli), involving low-level serial code.
- Wrote [several](https://aadishv.github.io/mcl/) [blog posts](https://aadishv.github.io/mcl-2x/) helping dozens of fellow competitors across the US, Canada, Hong Kong and even Thailand and Romania  with advanced topics in VEX.

**Miscellaneous**

- [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2024) 2024 participant [[code](https://github.com/aadishv/aoc)]
- [USACO](https://usaco.org) Silver competitor. [[code](https://github.com/aadishv/usaco)]
- Cofounded, maintain, and lead architectural decisions and code review for [Dotlist](https://github.com/dotlists/dotlib) and [Dotlist Lite](https://github.com/dotlists/dotlite), a family of open-source productivity managers.

**Non-programming related**

- Volunteer at several robotics competitions throughout the year; mentor new teams at an annual Girl Powered robotics workshop.
- Elected teaching assistant and peer tutor for math courses at OHS.
- Volunteer in the OHS student government's Board of Communications; wrote code to massively speed up the operations of the board.
