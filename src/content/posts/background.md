I have been programming for about 5 years and have participated in a variety of projects.

<ul>
<li>
    <em>Hackathons.</em>
    Won the OHS 2024 Labor Day Hackathon. Planning to a blog post about it
    later :) [<a href="https://github.com/aadishv/doleofdoves">code</a>]
</li>
<li>
    <em>Competitive programming.</em>
    <a href="https://adventofcode.com/2024">Advent of Code</a> 2024 participant.
    [<a href="https://github.com/aadishv/aoc">code</a>] <a href="https://usaco.org">USACO</a> Silver competitor.

<li>
    <em>Robotics.</em>
    Lead coder for VEX V5 Robotics Competition team <a
    href="https://www.robotevents.com/teams/V5RC/315P">315P</a
    > for Over Under and part of the High Stakes seasons. I have made a <a
    href="https://github.com/aadishv/highstakes">public mirror</a
    > of my High Stakes code available.
    <p>
    Lead AI programmer for VEX AI Robotics Competition team 3151A for the High Stakes and Push Back seasons (up until the present). Led work on system design, involving a raining & running a custom computer vision model. In total, designed and wrote over 8,000 lines of C++, Python, TypeScript, and shell.
    </p>
    <p>
    Today, I am exploring future-learning work for the team and pushing the state of the art in VEX, including
    <ul class="pb-1 -mt-2">
        <li style="line-height: 0.8rem;">GPU-accelerated Monte Carlo localization with a LiDAR,</li>
        <li style="line-height: 0.8rem;">clustering and object persistence using Kalman filters,</li>
        <li style="line-height: 0.8rem;">and much more.</li>
    </ul>
    Unfortunately, our code is our secret sauce, so I can't share it :)
    </p>
</li>
<li>
    <em>Open source.</em>
    In conjunction with my work in the VEX community, I've also worked on several open-source projects used by hundreds of robotics teams (VEX and professional):
    <p>
    A <a href="https://github.com/LemLib/LemLib/pull/274">bugfix PR to LemLib,</a> the most popular motion control and utilities library in the VEX V5 Robotics Competition. This PR is currently in review and fixes a critical bug in the library that would cause it to block indefinitely if motions were called under certain competition conditions.
    </p>
    <p>
    A <a href="https://github.com/Slamtec/rplidar_sdk/pull/141">bugfix PR to the RPLiDAR C++ SDK.</a> RPLiDAR is a very commonly used LiDAR series made by the Slamtec manufacturer, used in R&D, production cases, and also by the most technologically advanced VEX Robotics teams. This PR fixes a critical segfault in the SDK occuring due to a loop not checking for when a queue was empty.
    </p>
    <p>
        I am the creator and maintainer of <a href="https://github.com/aadishv/dishpy">DishPy</a>, a Python development tool for the VEX V5 supporting multiple files, any editor, a CLI, and libraries. This offers a massive advantage over the vanilla Micropython environment provided by VEX and is in use for competition by many teams. [<a href="/dishpy">docs</a> <a href="/dishpy-blog">blog post</a>]

    <em>Frontend development.</em>
    I use React and TailwindCSS with TypeScript to write web applications. I have used these technologies for several applications spanning several use cases.
    <p>
    Built <a href="https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/ohs-ac-utilities/mcnjeemajaoopeejjbfiieaepibmbjne">a Chrome extension</a>
    that allows OHS students to easily download Adobe Connect recordings. I am also currently working on adding AI summaries and chat features to improve students' experience when viewing class recordings.

    </p>
    <p>I've built <a href="/tools">several tools</a> and games as part of my <a href="https://aadishv.github.io/">website</a>. In total, my website has over 10,000 lines of TypeScript code.</p>
