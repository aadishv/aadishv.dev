**Last Updated:** May 16, 2025

Welcome to OHS AC Utilities (the "Extension")! This Chrome extension is a hobby project designed to help Stanford Online High School students download Adobe Connect recordings for their studies. This privacy policy explains how we handle your information.

**1. The Information We Handle (and Why)**

Our main goal is to help you download Adobe Connect recordings. To do this, the Extension needs certain permissions:

- **Access to Web Requests (`<all_urls>`):**
  - The Extension requests permission to access data from all websites (`<all_urls>`). This broad permission is currently requested to ensure we can reliably identify network requests made by the Adobe Connect platform, regardless of the specific Adobe Connect domain being used, and also due to some current technical limitations in how the extension identifies these requests.
  - **Crucially, while this permission grants broad access, we ONLY actively look for and process network requests related to Adobe Connect services (specifically those associated with domains like `pcadobeconnect.stanford.edu` and other Adobe Connect servers) to find the video information needed for download.**
  - We **do not** collect, store, or use data from any other websites you visit. We **do not** track your general Browse history.
- **User Activity (Network Monitoring for a Specific Purpose):**
  - As part of accessing web requests, we monitor network activity _solely_ to identify the data streams from Adobe Connect that constitute the recording you want to download.
- **Website Content (Adobe Connect Videos):**
  - The Extension interacts with website content to the extent necessary to identify and facilitate the download of Adobe Connect video recordings.

**2. How We Use Your Information**

The information the Extension accesses is used for the **single purpose** of enabling you to download Adobe Connect recordings:

- To identify the specific network requests from Adobe Connect's servers that contain the video data for your class recording.
- To allow your browser to then fetch and download this video directly from Adobe Connect's servers to your computer.

**ALL DATA PROCESSING HAPPENS LOCALLY WITHIN THE EXTENSION ON YOUR COMPUTER. NO DATA IS EVER SENT TO OUR SERVERS OR ANY THIRD-PARTY SERVERS BY US.**

- We **do not** sell or transfer your data to third parties.
- We **do not** use your data for any purposes unrelated to downloading Adobe Connect recordings (e.g., advertising, analytics unrelated to the core function, tracking).
- We **do not** use your data to determine creditworthiness or for lending purposes.

**3. Data Storage and Retention**

- The Extension processes information in real-time within your browser's JavaScript environment.
- We **do not store any of your personal data or Browse history.** Any data related to Adobe Connect URLs needed for a download is used temporarily for that download session and is not persistently stored by the Extension.
- The Extension uses the browser's "storage" permission because the underlying framework it was built with requires this permission. However, **OHS AC Utilities itself does not use this storage capability to save any of your personal data.**

**4. Data Sharing**

We do not share any data the Extension accesses with any third parties. The Extension's function is to enable _your browser_ to communicate directly with Adobe Connect's servers to download recordings. We are merely facilitating this direct interaction.

**5. Security**

All data processing by the Extension occurs locally on your device. This means the data stays within your browser and is not transmitted to us or any external servers by our design.

**6. Your Choices**

You can disable or uninstall the OHS AC Utilities extension at any time through your Chrome browser's extension management page. Uninstalling the Extension will remove its access to any future web requests.

**7. Changes to This Privacy Policy**

We may update this privacy policy from time to time. We will notify you of any significant changes by updating the "Last Updated" date at the top of this policy. We encourage you to review this policy periodically.

**8. Contact Us**

If you have any questions or concerns about this privacy policy or the Extension's practices, please feel free to reach out.
