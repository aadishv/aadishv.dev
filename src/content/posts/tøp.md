## RITN + TC have same setting

> i think its feasible but not super interesting. basically RITN is set in the same place as TC, makes sense since they both discuss "hallucinations" and are definitely set in some kind of mental/imaginary setting. Red theme is also the the same. not sure if it has any major implications, except maybe the hand that woke him into the imaginary setting in RITN MV was nico?

> further theory: entire lore is just a dream. RITN + TC are actually showing him the "real" setting of the home where he is trapped. thus the red accent compared to Dema grey & Bandito yellow. Also aligns with The Judge lyrics of trapped of the devil's home

(update 9/14/25: for god's sake how naive was I back then, literally all of clancy/breach is red themed)

## Blurryface is alter ego

is this even a theory?
basically my theory is that the other personality is Blurryface

> Goner: "I've got two faces Blurry's the one I'm not"
> Stressed Out: the bass voice portrayed with red eyes (?) in the video (update 9/14/25: is this just him being seized by a bishop?)
> The Judge: "I don't know if this one / Is about me or the devil", the devil being nico
> The Outside: why he is the only bandito/person who is able to possess the bishops
> Polarize: idk maybe opposite sides are him/nico?
> The Contract: seems to alternate between the two:
>   clancy: "I chеck the doors, check the windows, and pull the blinds / ... / I have a feeling that necromancer's outside"
>   nico: "I check the clock, wondering what he'll pull this time / And I'm just tryna stay quiet"


> another interesting thing about the dual personality theory, a LOT of lore-y songs have two lines/scenes:
> paladin strait: actual battle vs. the sitting on a cliff
> overcompensate: attic vs. auditorium
> navigating: drums vs. forest
> jumpsuit: burning car vs. valley
> levitate: w/ banditos vs. getting dragged away (?)
> etc.

## Chlorine is about his relationship w/ Nico

Seems to frame the battle as him loving the fun of the chase but also getting tired of it

## Choker <=> TC

> I read somewhere in the depths of reddit a theory that the Torchbearer in the contract was actually created by Nico to convince Clancy to become a bishop (the jacket at the end represents Clancy's "Breach" of contract with the banditos). if so, then Choker actually fits in really well right between Paladin Strait and the contract -- "Choker" obviously he is getting choked by nico, "I sign on the line" agrees to Nico's contract, "Alone, you're gonna change my circumstance" being a bishop will change Clancy, "You get taller, bolder, stronger and the rearview only blinds you" suggesting that it might actually be a good idea to be a bishop, etc.

## City Walls

Well, it happened.

I now use [Lyrix](https://github.com/aadishv/lyrix/), which is a simple tool I made for commenting on song lyrics. Below are my comments: [full share link](https://lyrix-eight.vercel.app/song?id=24004028&shared=21bc22). And yes, the mobile experience is terrible.

Songs that I have connected so far:
* overcompensate
* holding on to you
* truce
* migraine
* heavydirtysoul
* morph
* neon gravestones?
* goner
* not today
* the contract

My "Blurryface is an alter ego" theory is at least partially confirmed -- not in a way that I would have liked, but in a way that provides a fitting ending to this decade-old story. I talk in my comments about how Not Today, The Contract, Goner, etc. can be thought of as dually narrated by Clancy & Nico.
